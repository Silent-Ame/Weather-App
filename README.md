## Introduction
Tired of using the google weather application. I made my own Weather Application.
This simple weather application will only display the current weather for a given area.

My main Goal was to Learn to use REST API.

While learning NodeJS, I wanted to do something simple and fast. This project, is a web application allowing me to
display the weather, temperature or humidity, wind, 1 week forecast...

## Technologies
```
- Node.JS
- Javascript
- CSS
- Framework CSS (tailwindcss)
```
